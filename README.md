# Recipe App

## Description
The Recipe App allows users to explore a variety of recipes, search by name or ingredients, and add recipes to a personal cart. The app uses the MealDB API to retrieve recipe data, and users can add their recipes in cart with or without an account.

## Features Implemented

### New Features
1. **Authentication**: A basic authentication flow allows users to sign up or log in with their name, email, phone number, and password.
2. **All Recipes Page**: A dedicated page for users to view all available recipes.
3. **Add Recipe to Cart**: Users can add recipes to their cart.
   - If the user is not logged in, the cart data is stored locally.
   - If logged in, the cart data is saved to the userâ€™s account, allowing access across devices.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensured mobile responsiveness across all pages, with a consistent and accessible design style.

### Bug Fixes
1. **Search Functionality**: Fixed the search feature to work with both recipe names and ingredient names.
2. **Modal Image Display**: Resolved an issue where images in the recipe modals were not showing.
3. **Recipe Data Display in Modal**: Addressed a bug that caused recipe data not to display properly within modals.
